## Laravel Starter

A group of starter laravel setups to use.

## How to Setup

After cloning the repository run these commands:
- vagrant up
- composer install
- yarn install
- yarn run dev

(vagrant up may take a while on the first run)

While editing CSS/JS keep `yarn watch` running, so that you don't have to run `yarn run dev` after each change.
